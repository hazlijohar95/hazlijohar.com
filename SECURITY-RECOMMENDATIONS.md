# Security Recommendations & Implementation Guide

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Server-Side Rate Limiting Required

### Current Issue
The application currently uses client-side rate limiting, which provides **NO REAL SECURITY** and can be easily bypassed by attackers.

### Required Implementation
Choose one of these server-side approaches:

#### Option 1: Supabase Edge Functions (Recommended)
```typescript
// supabase/functions/rate-limit/index.ts
import { serve } from 'https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts'

serve(async (req) => {
  const ip = req.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') || 'unknown'
  const key = `rate_limit:${ip}`

  // Use Supabase Edge KV or external Redis
  const attempts = await getAttempts(key)

  if (attempts > 5) {
    return new Response('Rate limited', { status: 429 })
  }

  await incrementAttempts(key)
  return new Response('OK')
})
```

#### Option 2: Cloudflare Rate Limiting
```javascript
// Add to Cloudflare Workers or use Cloudflare Rate Limiting rules
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request))
})

async function handleRequest(request) {
  // Cloudflare automatically provides rate limiting
  // Configure in Cloudflare Dashboard
}
```

#### Option 3: Netlify Edge Functions
```typescript
// netlify/edge-functions/rate-limit.ts
import type { Context } from "@netlify/edge-functions"

export default async (request: Request, context: Context) => {
  const ip = context.ip
  // Implement rate limiting logic
}
```

### Priority: HIGH
This should be implemented before production deployment.

## 📋 Additional Security Recommendations

### 1. Environment Variable Security
- ✅ **FIXED**: Removed `.env` from repository
- 🔄 **ACTION REQUIRED**: Rotate any credentials that were previously committed
- 🔄 **ACTION REQUIRED**: Set environment variables in Netlify deployment settings

### 2. Content Security Policy
- ✅ **FIXED**: Removed `unsafe-inline` from CSP
- ✅ **FIXED**: Implemented hash-based CSP for Cal.com script

### 3. Authentication Security
- ✅ **FIXED**: Removed race conditions in AuthContext
- ✅ **FIXED**: Improved password re-authentication method
- 🔄 **RECOMMENDED**: Consider implementing MFA for admin accounts

### 4. Hash Function Security
- ✅ **FIXED**: Replaced weak hash function with SHA-256
- 🔄 **RECOMMENDED**: Migrate any existing data using old hash function

### 5. Debug Mode Security
- 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**: Fix debug mode exposure in production

## 🛡️ Security Checklist for Production

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Server-side rate limiting implemented
- [ ] All environment variables set in deployment platform
- [ ] Debug mode disabled in production
- [ ] Security headers configured in Netlify
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured
- [ ] WAF rules configured (if using Cloudflare)

### Post Deployment
- [ ] Security scan performed (OWASP ZAP or similar)
- [ ] Penetration testing conducted
- [ ] Error monitoring configured (Sentry)
- [ ] Security incident response plan documented
- [ ] Regular security updates scheduled

### Ongoing Monitoring
- [ ] CSP violation reports monitored
- [ ] Authentication failure patterns tracked
- [ ] API usage anomalies detected
- [ ] Security logs reviewed regularly
