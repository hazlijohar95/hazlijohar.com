# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the HJC Chartered Accountants application to protect user data, prevent vulnerabilities, and ensure compliance with security best practices.

## Security Features

### 1. Authentication & Authorization

- **Supabase Auth**: Secure authentication using Supabase's built-in auth system
- **Session Management**: Automatic session refresh and secure token handling
- **Route Protection**: Protected routes with proper authentication checks
- **Role-Based Access**: User-specific data access controls

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Zod Schema Validation**: Type-safe validation for all user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Comprehensive input sanitization to prevent cross-site scripting
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input validation
- **File Upload Security**: Strict file type and size validation

### 3. Data Protection

- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Secure File Storage**: Supabase Storage with access controls
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive configuration stored in environment variables
- **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets moved to environment configuration

### 4. Security Headers

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS and code injection attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions Policy**: Restricts browser features

### 5. Rate Limiting

- **Login Attempts**: Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- **API Protection**: Prevents abuse and brute force attacks
- **Configurable Limits**: Adjustable rate limiting parameters

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `env.example`:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# Security Configuration
VITE_ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false
VITE_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_ATTEMPTS=5
VITE_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
VITE_RATE_LIMIT_BLOCK_DURATION_MS=1800000

# File Upload Configuration
VITE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=10
```
